# MovieList
This program runs a simple webserver that allows my roommates and I to suggest movies and add them to a universal Movie List spreadsheet that we can all access. It allows for ranking priority, etc, all to help us choose what film we want to watch on movie night. 


Uses the Google Sheets API in order to interface with a Google spreadsheet stored in the cloud.
